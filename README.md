# Customer-Data-Automation
This repository contains an n8n automation workflow designed to process and organize customer data in a simple, structured, and efficient way. The workflow begins with a manual trigger, allowing the user to run it by clicking the “Execute Workflow” button inside the n8n editor. Once triggered, the workflow retrieves all customer records from the n8n Datastore using the getAllPeople operation. After the data is fetched, it is passed through an Edit Fields node where initial modifications, cleaning, or formatting are applied. This helps prepare the customer information before any conditional logic is executed.

The core logic of the workflow is handled by an IF node, which checks specific conditions in the customer data and then divides the data into two separate processing paths. If the condition is true, the data flows into the first Edit Fields node, where additional transformations or updates are applied to customers who meet the criteria. If the condition is false, the data moves into the second Edit Fields node, where a different set of changes is applied for customers who do not meet the required condition. This simple branching system makes it easy to separate high-priority customers from incomplete profiles or handle different data groups with tailored logic.

This workflow is ideal for learning how to use Datastores, Edit Fields, and IF nodes inside n8n. It demonstrates how to fetch records, clean the data, apply conditional logic, and process data in separate paths based on rules. It is suitable for beginners, training purposes, or anyone building a customer-focused automation system. The workflow can be easily expanded by adding webhooks, API connections, Google Sheets, Airtable, or notification systems. You can modify it to tag customers, validate fields, filter leads, or automate CRM pipelines.

The repository includes the exported JSON file of the workflow and can be imported directly into any n8n workspace. You can run the workflow instantly using the manual trigger, or extend it later to become fully automated. This project is licensed under the MIT License and is free to use and customize. If you need help improving this workflow or adding new features, I can create extended versions, diagrams, or advanced automation flows based on your requirements.
